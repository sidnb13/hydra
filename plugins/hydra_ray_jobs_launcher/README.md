# Hydra Ray Jobs Launcher
Provides a [Ray Jobs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/running-applications/job-submission/index.html) launcher for Hydra supporting distributed execution and job queuing.

## Development

Make sure you do **not** install the package in editable mode. This will cause Hydra to not be able to find the plugin.
